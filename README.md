# Hotel Menu Management System

Welcome to the Hotel Menu Management System! This simple Python program helps you manage food orders from a predefined hotel menu. It allows customers to add items to their order, check if the item is available, and displays the total amount at the end.

## Features:
- Display the hotel menu with item names and their prices.
- Allow the user to order items by entering their names.
- Supports case-insensitive input (e.g., "pizza", "PIZZA", "PiZzA").
- Allows users to add multiple items to the order.
- Shows the total amount for the items ordered.

## How to Use:

1. **Run the program**: When you start the program, you will see the list of items available in the menu.
2. **Order items**: Enter the name of the item you want to order. You can type it in any case (lowercase, uppercase, or mixed).
3. **Add more items**: The program will ask if you want to add another item to your order. You can keep adding items until you are done.
4. **View the total**: Once you choose not to add more items, the program will display the total amount of your order.
